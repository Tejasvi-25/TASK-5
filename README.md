**--** Heart Disease Prediction with Decision Trees and Random Forests

->> Objective

Learn and use tree based models for classifying data on the Heart Disease data.

->> Dataset

Prediction dataset Heart disease prediction problem The data used: Heart Disease Dataset (heart. csv)

Target: target (0 = No disease, 1 = Have disease)

->> Tools & Libraries

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Graphviz (if you want to generate nicer looking trees)

->> Tasks Performed

Load & Preprocess the dataset

Train a Decision Tree Classifier

Visualized using plot_tree()

Analyzed overfitting by adjusting max_depth

Train a Random Forest Classifier

Pitted against the Decision Tree

Interpreted Feature Importances

Evaluated Models using Cross-Validation
